Assembly language implementations of some simple unix utilities.  Written to
prove that it was possible, and to show how small they could be.

This was in the era before ELF binaries, so it is simpler to make a small
executable.  However, this does mean that these examples are not going to work
on any modern Linux system.

None the less, the Makefile has been updated to allow compiling on modern
systems.  The resulting binaries are not quite the same as those from the
original compile

- The original binaries are "OMAGIC", the binaries compiled with a current
  toolchain are "QMAGIC"
- The padding used changed from 0x90 (NOP) to 0x00
- The original binaries were padded to an 8 byte boundary, the current
  toolchain pads to a 4096 byte boundary
